## General Information
- The goal of this model is to predict a neutrino particleâ€™s direction, based on data from the "IceCube" detector, which observes the cosmos from deep within the South Pole ice.
- This project is designed to achieve similar performance to Graphnet using less complicated architecture and to achieve better performance with similar complexity
